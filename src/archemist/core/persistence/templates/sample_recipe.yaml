# workflow recipe sample
# name: the given recipe name
# id: the recipe unique workflow id
# materials: recipe materials section
#   liquids: the liquids' names that will be used in the recipe
#   solids: the solids' names that will be used in the recipe
# stations: recipe stations section that will describe all the stations
#           utilized in the experiment
#   name: name of the station. This should come in the format station_name.id_xx
#          where xx is the station unique id
#   stationOps: station operation section that will describe all the operations
#               to be used by the recipe in this experiment
#     type: the operation class name as defined in archemist.stations.X.state
#           note that X stands for the stations's given module found in archemist's 
#           stations module
#     properties: operation properties
# workflowSM: workflow state machine describing the experiment process
#             that is composed of state and their transitions, currently only
#             sequential process are possible. Note that a workflow can have any
#             number of states and their transitions.
#   state_name: name of the state in the form: station_name.id_xx.op_type where
#               station_name and xx refer to the station name and id, while op_type
#               stands for the operation to use
#   onSuccess: the new state the workflow will transition to in case the current state
#              is executed successfully
#   onFail: the new state the workflow will transition to in case the current state
#              execution fails
